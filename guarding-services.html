                <h1>Guardian Services</h1>
                <p>Following types of guarding services are offered by us:
                    <br>
                    <h3>Office Guards</h3>
                    <p>They provide surveillance and protection services for persons and property in an office environment. They have a three fold mission: reception, observation and control. Reception involves escorting and guidance of visitors, delivery
                        of badges and managing telephone calls. Observation includes regulation of movement of staff and visitors and their vehicles. Control involves management of keys, badges and electronic security systems. To facilitate integration
                        into the client’s environment, while keeping necessary distance essential for the security mission, office guards are chosen for their sociability, courtesy and presentation.</p>

                    <h3>Industrial Guards</h3>
                    <p>
                        They provide surveillance of persons, equipment and goods in an industrial environment aimed at prevention of losses and maintenance of production flows. We ensure that the guards are physically robust, have a sense of responsibility and possess all round
                        communication skills. Their typical assignments are physical access control, personnel checks, and management of visitors, reception and routing of goods, management of electronic alarms and CCTV and external &amp; internal prevention
                        rounds.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Executive Protection</h3>
                    <p>VIP security services provide professional personal security to Captains of the Industry, diplomats and celebrities. A security assessment of the client, his/her family, home and work environment is conducted. The risks can vary from
                        violation of privacy, unwanted media exposure to threat to life and property. Services provided include security drivers, personal bodyguard, escort teams (several bodyguards) and residential security teams for permanent/temporary
                        residences, offices, venues, holiday resorts and high profile events. VIP personal bodyguards are trained in martial arts and use of firearms. They are young, motivated, disciplined &amp; well groomed and can operate unobtrusively
                        in any environment. We are proud to state that “Ms Julia Roberts” the renowned Hollywood actor has been one of our esteemed client. We earned laurels from print &amp; electronics media on this important &amp; challenging assignment.
